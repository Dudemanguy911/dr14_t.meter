.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBDR14 T.meter\fR is a free and opens source command line tool for computing the Dynamic Range of your music according to the procedure used in the off\-line meter released by the Pleasurize Music Foundation.

This tool is very useful to measure how is loud your music and for understanding that a good quality album always has also a good dynamic, and it's also useful for understanding the effects of the so called loudness war.
